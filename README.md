I download lots of files. I delete lots of files. 

It's annoying to click through every single subdirectory to find the big files to delete. Also, the native windows GUI is pretty unintuitive for this purpose. 

What if you could tell a script to scan your machine and spit out shortcuts to the top 10 largest files? Hassle free.

Also supports (hopefully, in the future): top "X" files, image extension and file attribute filtering (inclusive and exclusive)
Uses os.walk, aka scandir, to do the combing. Uses numpy to make the data matrix. Uses quick sort to sort everything.

This is also my first ever code project! So, if you have any feedback, please tell me! (Yes this could be a bash script I know, I'm in too deep now). In its current state, it is functional. Will rewrite the whole thing to be way more efficient later, or until someone on this website asks me to
